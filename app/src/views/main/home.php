        <h4>Overwatch League's tiebreaking system is complicated. It's pretty routine to see scenarios where teams could
            make it to the playoffs, but don't, because they don't win both their matches in the final week 4-0, and another
            team wins their two matches 3-2. Making sense of it all can be hard. The aim of this site is to help solve that.</h4>
